# Google-slides-crash
this exploit effects lower end computers like Chromebooks and old laptops.
how this exploit works is you copy and paste the text into the speaker notes and it makes the slide inecssible to most people the way around this is if you minimize the speaker notes bar
i think i found out how this works but idk
Edit: i dont think that this is an exploit anymore because if you just input any amount of text it will crash the slides
